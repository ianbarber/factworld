"""World configuration.

Sizes are calibrated against canonical recall/state-tracking benchmarks (canonical MQAR only became a
real recall stress test at vocab 8192 / 64-KV / train-len 512 / ~10M params; the S_k word
problem at train-len 32 still extrapolated to 0% at 2-4x). They remain knobs — the exact
recall scale is meant to be empirically calibrated in the model phase (down until pure
Mamba-2 fails and the GDN-hybrid succeeds, mirroring the MQAR separation) — but the defaults
are deliberately in the non-trivial regime, NOT the 256-fact lookup-table regime.
